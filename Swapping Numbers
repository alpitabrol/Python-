In-Place Swapping Of Two Numbers is very easy which is.


x, y = 10, 20

print(x, y) 

x, y = y, x 

print(x, y) 

Even, Reverse swapping is also possible.

Program/Source Code:

Here is the source code of a Python program to convert binary to Gray codeword. The program output is shown below.

def binary_to_gray(n):
    """Convert Binary to Gray codeword and return it."""
    n = int(n, 2) # convert to int
    n ^= (n >> 1)
 
    # bin(n) returns n's binary representation with a '0b' prefixed
    # the slice operation is to remove the prefix
    return bin(n)[2:]
 
 
g = input('Enter binary number: ')
b = binary_to_gray(g)
print('Gray codeword:', b)
